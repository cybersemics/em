        Only breaks on Enter or Backspace, not gesture.

        setTimeout fixes it, however it introduces an infinite loop when a nested empty thought is created.
        Not calling asyncFocus when the selection is already on a thought prevents the infinite loop.
        Also, setTimeout is frequently pushed into the next frame and the keyboard will intermittently close on iOS Safari.
        Replacing setTimeout with requestAnimationFrame guarantees (hopefully?) that it will be processed before the next repaint,
        keeping the keyboard open while rapidly deleting thoughts. (#3129)
