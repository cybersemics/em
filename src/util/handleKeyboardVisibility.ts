/**
 * Monitors viewport resize events to detect virtual keyboard visibility changes.
 *
 * This is primarily needed for Android devices when a user navigates away using
 * the back button (dismissing the keyboard) or other UI elements, it won't trigger
 * the blur event. In contrast, iOS typically handles this automatically.
 *
 * When a significant viewport height increase is detected (indicating keyboard closing),
 * and the width hasn't decreased significantly (not a rotation), this utility dispatches 
 * an action to exit editing mode, preventing the UI from remaining in an inconsistent 
 * state where editing UI controls are visible but the keyboard is closed.
 
 * @returns A throttled function that should be attached to viewport resize events.
