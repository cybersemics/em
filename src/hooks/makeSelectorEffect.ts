import { useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react'

/**
 * Creates a useLayoutEffect hook that invokes a callback when a slice of a given store's state changes. Unlike useSelector, this hook does NOT trigger re-renders - it calls the effect directly when the selected state changes. This is useful for DOM calculations that need to be performed after a state change but should not cause component re-renders.
 *
 * @template U - Store type with generic state.
 * @param store - The store instance to subscribe to.
 *
 * @returns A hook function that takes:
 * - effect: Callback to run when selected state changes. Should be memoized with useCallback to prevent recreation on each render.
 * - select: Selector function to pick state slice. Should be memoized or defined outside component to prevent recreation.
 * - equalityFn: Optional comparison function for state changes. Should be stable (e.g. lodash isEqual) or memoized.
 *
 * @example
 * // Create a selector effect for a specific store
 * const useSelectorEffect = makeSelectorEffect(myStore)
 *
 * // Use in component - memoize functions to prevent recreation
 * const select = useCallback(state => state.someValue, [])
 * const effect = useCallback(newValue => {
 * // This runs without causing a re-render
 * updateDOM(newValue)
 * }, [])
 * useSelectorEffect(effect, select, isEqual)
