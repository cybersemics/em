        Anticipate cliff change on new thought

        There is a special case for the y position when creating a new thought at the end of a context. The former last thought (what will become the new thought's previous sibling) loses its cliff, e.g. cliff changes from -1 to 0. This causes it to lots its cliffPaddingStyle, and thus its height will decrease slightly. However, when the new thought is rendered, its y position is determined by the previous thought's cached height. The height is only re-measured after the nxet render. This causes the new thought's y position to decrease by the cliff padding over a single frame. It will appear to slide up as it animates into the correct y position (based on the updated previous sibling's measurement).

        Solution: Check if a new thought is being rendered at the cliff, and anticipate the updated y position by subtracting cliffPadding. This does not apply if the previous thought's depth is greater than the new thought's depth, as it will not be losing its cliff. It only applies if the prevous thought is a sibling or parent and is losing its cliff.

        (It may have been better to directly check if the previous thought is losing its cliff, however that would require persisting the last cliff for each thought in a ref. The additional state is less than ideal, but it can be pursued if it is discovered that this simple condition has any false positives/negatives.)

        e.g. `a` will lose its cliff but its height will not be re-measured until after [empty] has been rendered with the wrong y
          - a
          - [empty]
