Dependency notes:
  - html-escaper     Replace 'he' with 'html-escaper' due to bundle size.
                     Other small HTML entity encoder/decoders: entities, html-entities
  - page-lifecycle   Use https://github.com/magic-akari/page-lifecycle/tree/feat/add-types
                     to get Typescript types.
