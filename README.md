# em

**em** is a beautiful, minimalistic note-taking app for personal sensemaking.

**em** is:

- **cognitively-informed** - Supports focus, nonlinearity, and associative connectivity.
- **process-oriented** - Facilitates flow and organic thinking.
- **semiotic** - Mediates concept through a monistic, contextual semiotic web.

## Web App Development

Start the live-reload server for local development:

```sh
npm start
```

Test a production build:

```sh
npm run build
npm servebuild
```

To enable device syncing, start the websocket server:

```sh
npm run websocket-server
```

## Native App Development

To get started, run `npm run cap:ios` or `npm run cap:android`.

- `cap:ios` - Generates iOS project files with capacitor and opens the project in XCode. Requires XCode and CocoaPods to be installed. Choose your device target and hit Play in XCode to build and run the app.
- `cap:android` - Generates Android project files with capacitor and opens the project in Android Studio.
- `cap:copy` - Copies the web app build and capacitor configuration file into the native platform project. Run this each time you make changes that are not picked up by the live-reload server, and when you change a configuration value in capacitor.config.ts.
- `cap:sync` - Runs cap:copy and updates native capacitor plugins.

The above scripts run in development mode by default. You can copy or sync in production mode with these:

- `cap:copy:prod`
- `cap:sync:prod`

## Component Hierarchy

Root containers:

Each thought consists of many layers of components that provide various functionalities. This is necessary from a performance perspective to avoid re-rendering all thought components when a small slice changes, when a thought falls outside the viewport and can be virtualized.

```
└─Content
  └─LayoutTree
    └─LayoutShim
      └─VirtualThought
        └─ThoughtContainer
          ├─Bullet
          ├─ThoughtAnnotation
          │ └─Superscript
          └─StaticThought
            └─Editable
```

- `<Content>` - a root container that defines the margins of the thoughtspace and handles clicking on empty space.
- `<LayoutTree>` - a root container that defines the margins of the thoughtspace and handles clicking on empty space.

- `<VirtualThought>` - Conditionally renders a shim when the thought is hidden by autofocus. The shim is a simple div with a height attribute matching the thought's height.
- `<ThoughtContainer>` - Contains the Bullet, ThoughtAnnotation, and StaticThought for a single thought.
- `<Bullet>` - This is, unsurprisingly, the bullet of the thought.
- `<ThoughtAnnotation>` - A non-interactive, hidden clone of StaticThought that is used to position the Superscript.
- `<StaticThought>` - Contains the Editable and Superscript.
- `<Editable>` - Renders the thought text as a content-editable and handles live editing, throttled updates, selection, pasting, and all other editing capacities.
